//! Chunked Upload Port - Application layer abstraction for resumable chunked uploads.
//!
//! This module defines the port (trait) and DTOs for chunked/resumable upload
//! operations, keeping the application and interface layers independent of
//! the specific upload implementation (TUS-like protocol, S3 multipart, etc.).
