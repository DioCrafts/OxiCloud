//! Infrastructure Adapters
//!
//! This module contains adapters that bridge the gap between domain repositories
//! and application ports. These adapters implement the application layer ports
//! using the infrastructure layer repositories.
//!
//! It also includes error adapters for converting infrastructure-specific errors
//! to domain errors, following Clean Architecture principles.
